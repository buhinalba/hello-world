# hello-world
my first repository
I made this repo for practice. I enjoy doing a lot of things, including doing 'nothing'. When I am doing 'nothing' I like to take a nap, or sketch something real quick.
Keep in mind the words of Winnie the Pooh, my long time girl-buddy: ,,Don't underestimate the value of doing nothing, of just going along listening to all the things you can't hear and not bothering.''
